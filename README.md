# FloralApp
This is a test prototype in progress. 
This a test prototype that I created that is still a work in progress. The project was to create a floral app that would allow the florist to easily create new floral arrangements and allow the customers to see digital previews. The types of vases and flowers could be easily customized to the perfect specifications, while also giving a dollar amount for the arrangements.
